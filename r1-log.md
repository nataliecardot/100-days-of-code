My #100DaysOfCode challenge log. Started Sunday, March 18, 2018.

## Log

#### R1D1

**Today's Progress:** Started on creating a to-do list using jQuery, CSS, and HTML.
So far the user can add an item and click it to remove it from the list.

**Link to Work:** [Simple to-do list](https://codepen.io/nataliecardot/pen/VXmPrO)

#### R1D2

**Today's Progress:**
Updated styling and tweaked functionality of the vanilla JS version of my pixel art maker, including making it so the default grid size appears on page load (as opposed to having to first hit 'submit'). Also worked toward adding an erase feature (coming up with some ideas as to how it could be done).

#### R1D6

**Today's Progress:**

#### R1D10

**Today's Progress:**
Changed the styling of my color picker and looked into ways to add additional ones with preset colors. The updated appearance is sleeker, but it seems it's not feasible to have more than one functioning color picker, and doing so would require installation of plugins/software.

#### R1D11

**Today's Progress:**
Fixed a couple bugs that occurred while using the newly added 'draw' mode in my pixel art maker (vanilla JS version). Slightly modified styling of both versions. Removed additional nonfunctioning color pickers for now but continued to investigate methods of having multiple.

#### R1D12

**Today's Progress:**
Made a further attempt to add additional color pickers to my pixel art maker as well as to add CSS to automatically align the input box/toolbar relative to the grid with each addition/removal of content. Both unsuccessful (the latter may not be possible).

#### R1D13

**Today's Progress:**
Updated styling and functionality of my jQuery to-do list, including adding strike-through and fade-out of completed items, banded coloring of list items, and appearance change upon hovering over list items.
