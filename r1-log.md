My #100DaysOfCode challenge log. Started Sunday, March 18, 2018.

## Log

#### R1D1

**Today's Progress:** Started on creating a to-do list using jQuery, CSS, and HTML.
So far the user can add an item and click it to remove it from the list.

#### R1D2

**Today's Progress:**
Updated styling and tweaked functionality of the vanilla JS version of my pixel art maker, including making it so the default grid size appears on page load (as opposed to having to first hit 'submit'). Also worked toward adding an erase feature (coming up with some ideas as to how it could be done).
